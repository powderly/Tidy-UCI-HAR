- the Tidy Data set contains:
  + 10299 complete rows of observations
  + 88 variable columns (2 identifiers, 86 measurements
- it is in a wide-format configuration

## Identifier Columns

- "1" "subjects" -- There are 30 unique subjects, originally in two datasets (training and testing) but they have been merged herein.
- "2" "activities" -- There are 6 unique activities that represent the six possible states in which a subject can generate data: 
  + 1) walking, 
  + 2) walking.upstairs, 
  + 3) walking.downstairs, 
  + 4) sitting, 
  + 5) standing, 
  + 6)laying

Variable Selection
-------------------

The UCI-HAR-Dataset variables selected for this database originally come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Variable Subset Selection
--------------------------

The subset of the original variables was selected for two reasons:
  + 1) they could be easily obtained using grep on the pattern "std" and "mean" within the original variable names
  + 2) they represent a standard deviation and mean calculation in each representative category: X, Y, Z, gyro, acc, jerk, mag, body, gravity, mad, max,min, sma, energy, igr, entropy, arcoeff, correlation, maxInds, freq, skew, kurtosis, bands and angle
